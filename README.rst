**IS 210 CMATH MODULE**
--------------------------
Overview
++++++++
cmath module comes with the standard python library. It provides access to the
mathematical functions. The main reason for chosing this module is that we
have or we can encounter some problems that needs access to basic mathematical
functions which includes but not limited to floor, cieling, power, lograthimic,
exponential, factorial functions. Also math module comes already installed in
the standard python library. We need to use the import command to get access
to all these functions.


*Execution*
------------------------

>>> import math
>>> math.factorial(4)
24
>>> math.fabs(-9)
9.0
>>> math.pow(3,2)
9.0
>>> math.log10(2)
0.3010299956639812
>>> math.pi
3.141592653589793
>>> math.sin(90)
0.8939966636005579
>>> math.ceil(3.5)
4.0
>>> math.ceil(3.4)
4.0
>>> math.floor(3.4)
3.0
